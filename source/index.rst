Ayomide Yissa's Technical Writing Portfolio!
=================================================================

Hello! My name is Ayomide Yissa and I am a technical writer. Welcome to my Portfolio!

I have over 3 years of technical writing experience in:

- Scoping and creating technical content, 
- Designing Information Architecture strategies 
- Maintaining technical documentation 
- Contributing technical articles to B2B and B2C Organizations 

I am a freelance technical writer specializing in clearly and concisely communicating complex concepts. 

Over the span of my career, I have worked with Software and API development teams, honing my skills in producing excellent product documentation, developer guides, API docs, and web content across multiple industries. 

I have documented APIs for sports and fintech products and contributed  documentation workflows for product teams. I also actively contribute to open-source projects by improving the usability and readability of open-source technical documentation.

Published in 2024, I contributed to the `2nd edition of the Technical Writing process <https://boffin.education/the-technical-writing-process-2024-2nd-edition/>`_ book.
